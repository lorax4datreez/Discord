Our crews are all graduates of the TDD's Merchant Marine program and as such understand the importance of being ready and able to take their role as an auxiliary force to the combat arms of Nova.  With their cross training these merchant mariners have unique ability and insight to haul the most dangerous loads in the most treacherous places - Lorville's Pad 8 for example. They are also willing and able to take up arms and defend what they have fought hard to supply alongside our Combat Arms brethren at Nova. We are always true to our motto Semper Gumbybus - Always Flexible!",
